This repository contains the data used in the paper "Quasars Have Fewer Close 
Companions than Normal Galaxies" by Yue et al. There are four files:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mastersample.fits
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a file containing the information of all the quasars in the master 
sample. The columns are:

NAME: the name of the quasar

RA, DEC: the coordinate of the quasar

REDSHIFT: the redshift of the quasar

MI: the magnitude, M_i(z=2), of the quasar

CATALOG: the catalog where this quasar is adopted. Could be "DR7" (which means 
SDSS DR7 quasar catalog), "DR12" (which means SDSS DR12 quasar catalog), and
"VERON" (which means Veron catalog of AGN, 13th version).

RELATED: whether the quasar is observed in a program that is relevant to 
AGN study. Equals 1 if it is observed in an AGN-related project; equals 0 
otherwise.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sampleA.fits
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a file containing the information of all the quasars in sample A. The 
columns are:

NAME: the name of the quasar

RA, DEC: the coordinate of the quasar

REDSHIFT: the redshift of the quasar

MI: the magnitude, M_i(z=2), of the quasar

CATALOG: the catalog where this quasar is adopted. Could be "DR7" (which means 
SDSS DR7 quasar catalog), "DR12" (which means SDSS DR12 quasar catalog), and
"VERON" (which means Veron catalog of AGN, 13th version).

FILTER: the filter in which the quasar was observed

HLAIMAGE: the name of the image generated by HLA that contains this quasar.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sampleB.fits
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similar to sampleA.fits, but for sample B quasars.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
allcompA.fits
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The companions around quasars in sample A which have a projected distance of 
10 kpc to 100kpc. This catalog include all SEXTRACTOR detections around the 
quasars, i.e., both real and project companions are included. The columns are:

NAME: the name of the quasar

RA_Q, DEC_Q: the coordinate of the quasar

REDSHIFT_Q: the redshift of the quasar

RA_C, DEC_C: the coordinate of the companion

MAG, MAGERR: the apparent magnitude (AB) of the companion and its error

DISTANCE: the projected distance from the companion to the quasar, in arcsec.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
allcompB.fits
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similar to allcompA.fits, but for sample B quasars.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cutout (folder)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This zip file contains all the image cutouts of the "on-going merging system" 
described in section 3.3.1.
