## Note on this project

Since the co-authors have some common concerns about the data analysis, I decided to re-do everything.

Here are the detailed procedure as of 2018/07/14:

### PSF subtraction

We use TinyTim to generate PSF models for the following reasons:
- For companion detection, subtracting the wings is much more useful than subtracting the central pixels of a PSF.
TinyTim PSFs can have a diameter as large as 30 arcsecs, which is hard to achieve for PSF stars. Thus modeled PSF works 
better in subtracting the wing of PSF.
- It is straightforward to handle the spatial and time variation of PSF models.
- TinyTim PSF models are noiseless, while PSF stars have non-negligible noise, especially when the PSF star 
is fainter than the quasar (which means larger statistical error). The noise in PSF star images is very obvious in F850LP band.

How I do it:
- Read the time and spatial information from the image.
- Use TinyTim to gfenerate a 400 * 400 pixel (20 * 20 arcsec)
-
